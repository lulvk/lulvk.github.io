I will efficiently proofread your scientific articles, in English or French.

I will proofread and edit your documents for:
* Spellings

... but also for:
* Consistency
* Readability
* Flow


Why me?

I am published in high-quality peer-reviewed journals, such as IEEE Access, Physics in Biology & Medicine, and Signal Processing: Image Communication.
I have reviewed manuscripts for IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics, and Journal of Digital Imaging (among others).
