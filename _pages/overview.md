I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [LS2N Laboratory](https://www.ls2n.fr/?lang=en){:target="_blank"} (Nantes Laboratory of Digital Sciences), [Polytech](https://polytech.univ-nantes.fr/en){:target="_blank"}, [Nantes Universit√©](https://www.english.univ-nantes.fr/){:target="_blank"}, France. My research interests include human-computer interaction (HCI), computer vision, visual perception and attention, and medical imaging.

I received the M.Eng. degree in cognitive engineering from the National Superior School of Cognitics, Bordeaux, France, in 2015, the M.Sc. degree in biomedical imaging from the University of Angers, France, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/computer-science){:target="_blank"}, Cardiff University, United Kingdom, in 2019.

From 2017 to 2020, I was the leader of Qualinet task force 3: Quality of Experience (QoE) in medical imaging and healthcare. I am now vice chair of the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) on [Quality Assessment for Health Applications](https://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/vqeg/projects/quality-assessment-for-health-applications-qah.aspx){:target="_blank"}.
