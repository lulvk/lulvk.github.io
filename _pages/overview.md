Welcome to my website!
I am currently retiring from academia and starting a career transition. In the meantime, I have been working as a [freelance proofreader](https://lulvk.github.io/freelance/){:target="_blank"}.

Background
==

I received the M.Eng. degree in applied cognitive engineering from the National Superior School of Cognitics of Bordeaux (France) in 2015; the M.Sc. degree in biomedical imaging from the University of Angers (France), in 2015; and the Ph.D. degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering of Cardiff University (UK) in 2019.

My research interests used to include human-computer interaction, computer vision, visual perception and attention, and medical imaging.

From 2017 to 2020, I was the leader of Qualinet task force 3: Quality of Experience in medical imaging and healthcare. I was vice chair of the Video Quality Experts Group (VQEG) on Quality Assessment for Health Applications between 2020 and 2023.
