I am a 28-year old (soon 29!) French woman.


Traveling
====

... has been my greatest passion for ten years. I want to keep a childlike sense of wonder about the world. <br />
There is always something new to learn, always something wonderful to discover and to explore.

**Countries I have visited**: Belgium, Cabo Verde, Canada, China, Cuba, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece, <br />
Hong Kong, Iceland, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Macao, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Spain, <br />
Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States.

On my **bucket list?** Australia, Brazil, Croatia, Mauritius, Namibia, New Zealand, Oman, Tanzania...

Sports
====

... is also something I am keen on: **swimming** and **hiking** are probably among my favourite. <br />
But I like cycling, dancing, and horse riding as well. I have recently started bouldering (indoors) and climbing (_via ferrata_).

What's **next**? Downhill moutain biking in the Alps (Spring or Summer 2021)!

And to decompress?
====

I have been practising **yoga** and **meditation** for a few years. I enjoy reading a good book in the sun. <br />
But, all things considered, peeting my **cat** remains the best way to relax ;-)
